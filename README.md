In this task, I created a Python script to automatically resize images using the Pillow (PIL) library. The program reads all images from an input folder, resizes them to a fixed dimension, 
and saves the processed versions into an output folder. This task helped me understand image processing, file handling, and automation in Python.

What I Did:

Built a folder structure with images_input, images_output, and image_resizer.py.

Used Pillow (PIL.Image) to open, resize, and save images.

Handled multiple images using loops and automated folder creation.

Implemented dynamic path handling with the os module.

Displayed progress messages for better user feedback.
